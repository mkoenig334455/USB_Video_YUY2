USB_Video_STM32F407VGTX_YUY2 example USB and VIDEO class

This example will create a "camera interface" in the windows "device manager" by USB. 
You can open the camera device by VLC or windows camera and you will se two pictures toggeling as video stream (pink and green)

I use: STM32CubeIDE 1.14.0 CubeMX 6.10.0 STM32F407VGTX + PHY USB3310 / USB HighSpeed
